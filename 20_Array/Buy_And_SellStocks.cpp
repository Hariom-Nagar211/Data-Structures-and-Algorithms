// Problem: Given an array where each element represents the price of a stock on a given day, 
// find the maximum profit you can achieve by buying and selling the stock. You can only complete one transaction 
// (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock). Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

// Brute
// LC : Try out all differences in array
// TC : O(n*n)
// SC : O(1)

// Optimal
// LC : Keep track of minimum price and maximum profit
// TC : O(n)  
// SC : O(1)
