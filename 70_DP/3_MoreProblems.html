        <h1>Dynamic Programming Practice Questions</h1>
        <p>Building on the problems you've already solved, here are some more similar Dynamic Programming questions with direct links to practice platforms. These are excellent problems to strengthen your DP skills for an online assessment.</p>

        <h2>LeetCode</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Climbing Stairs</strong> <span class="difficulty">(Easy)</span>: A direct variant of the Frog Jump problem, where you can take one or two steps at a time to reach the top. It's a great way to reinforce the fundamental recurrence relation.</p>
                <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/" target="_blank">Climbing Stairs on LeetCode</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Min Cost Climbing Stairs</strong> <span class="difficulty">(Easy)</span>: This problem adds a cost element to the climbing scenario. The goal is to find the minimum cost to reach the top, requiring you to find the minimum value between two possible previous steps.</p>
                <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/" target="_blank">Min Cost Climbing Stairs on LeetCode</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>House Robber II</strong> <span class="difficulty">(Medium)</span>: This is a follow-up to the House Robber problem. The twist is that the houses are arranged in a circle, meaning the first and last houses are adjacent. This requires splitting the problem into two subproblems.</p>
                <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii/" target="_blank">House Robber II on LeetCode</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Jump Game</strong> <span class="difficulty">(Medium)</span>: This problem tests your ability to determine if a destination is reachable from the starting point. It can be solved effectively with a greedy approach, but it's also a classic DP problem to consider.</p>
                <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/" target="_blank">Jump Game on LeetCode</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Jump Game II</strong> <span class="difficulty">(Medium)</span>: The next step up from Jump Game, this problem asks for the minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the array. It's a great exercise in optimizing your DP state.</p>

        </ul>

        <h2>GeeksforGeeks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Maximum sum in a circular array such that no two elements are adjacent</strong>: This is the same problem as LeetCode's House Robber II. Practicing it on another platform can provide a different perspective and different test cases.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Longest Increasing Subsequence</strong>: A fundamental DP problem that is frequently asked in interviews. It teaches the core concepts of building up a solution from smaller subproblems on a sequence.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Coin Change</strong>: This problem introduces a new DP pattern related to finding minimum counts or total ways to make a specific sum. It is a cornerstone problem for understanding knapsack-style DP problems.</p>
